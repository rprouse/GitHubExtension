GitHub Visual Studio Extension
===============

A visual studio extension for working with issues on GitHub. 

I am just about ready for an alpha release. If you would like to try out the extension and influence its development, add a comment to https://github.com/rprouse/GitHubExtension/issues/47 and I will get in touch.

## Instructions ##

- Log in to GitHub by clicking the logon icon at the upper right of the issue list window
- Open the issue window by double clicking an issue in the list, or by going to *View | Other Windows | GitHub Issue Window* (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+H)
- Add a new issue to the selected repository with the + button in the issue list, or from *Tools | New Issue on GitHub* (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+I)
- Edit an issue with the edit button on the Issue window
